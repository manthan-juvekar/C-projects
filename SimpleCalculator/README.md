# Simple Calculator

A simple and efficient calculator built using the C programming language. This project supports common arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and exponentiation. It's a great example of using basic C concepts like control structures, functions, and input/output operations to build a functional application.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division**: Divides the first number by the second (with error handling for division by zero).
- **Modulus**: Computes the remainder of the division of two integers.
- **Exponentiation**: Raises the first number to the power of the second.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Compiler**: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
- **Mathematical Functions**: Standard math library (`math.h`)

## Installation
